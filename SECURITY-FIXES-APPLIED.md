# Security Fixes Applied - Square Menu Display Premium Deluxe Pro

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Version:** 3.0 (Security Hardened)
**Review Grade:** C+ → A-

---

## 🔒 CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Webhook Authentication Bypass (FIXED) ✅
**File:** `smdp-webhook.php` (lines 49-73)

**Previous Issue:** Webhook continued processing even when signature verification failed, allowing attackers to send fake webhooks.

**Fix Applied:**
- Now returns HTTP 403 when signature verification fails
- Returns HTTP 500 when signature key is not configured
- Properly rejects all invalid webhook requests
- Uses canonical `rest_url()` to prevent HTTP Host header injection

**Security Impact:** **HIGH** - Critical authentication vulnerability eliminated

---

### 2. Bill Endpoint Authorization (ENHANCED) ✅
**File:** `includes/class-help-request.php` (lines 167-194, 156-174, 176-194)

**Previous Issue:** Unauthenticated users could enumerate table numbers and access order data.

**Fixes Applied:**
- Added rate limiting (10 requests per 60 seconds) to `ajax_get_bill()`
- Added rate limiting (5 requests per 60 seconds) to `ajax_help()` and `ajax_bill()`
- Implemented table number format validation (alphanumeric, 1-10 chars)
- Logs all invalid table number attempts for security monitoring

**Security Impact:** **HIGH** - Information disclosure and enumeration attacks mitigated

---

## 🛡️ HIGH PRIORITY FIXES

### 3. Square ID Format Validation (NEW) ✅
**File:** `includes/constants.php` (lines 307-397)

**What Was Added:**
New validation functions for all Square API identifiers:
- `smdp_validate_catalog_id()` - Validates catalog object IDs (20-32 chars)
- `smdp_validate_customer_id()` - Validates customer IDs (10-50 chars)
- `smdp_validate_location_id()` - Validates location IDs (10-50 chars)
- `smdp_validate_order_id()` - Validates order IDs (10-100 chars)
- `smdp_validate_access_token()` - Validates and sanitizes access tokens

**Applied In:**
- `class-admin-pages.php` (line 211) - Token validation before storage
- `class-help-request.php` (lines 400-418) - Location and item ID validation

**Security Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Prevents injection attacks via malformed IDs

---

### 4. Enhanced Rate Limiting (UPGRADED) ✅
**File:** `includes/constants.php` (lines 229-293)

**Previous Method:** IP address only (easily bypassed)

**New Method:**
- Multi-factor tracking: IP + User-Agent + User ID
- IP validation using `filter_var()` with `FILTER_VALIDATE_IP`
- Exponential backoff (doubles lockout time for persistent attackers)
- Shortened transient keys using MD5 hashing
- Detailed security logging

**Security Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Much harder to bypass via VPN/proxy rotation

---

### 5. Sensitive Debug Logging (SECURED) ✅
**File:** `includes/class-oauth-handler.php` (lines 172-177, 207-210, 228-258, 480-506)

**What Changed:**
- Wrapped all sensitive logging in `WP_DEBUG` checks
- Removed token previews from logs
- Removed API response body logging (except errors)
- Reduced log verbosity for successful operations
- Only log failures and critical errors

**Security Impact:** **MEDIUM** - Prevents sensitive data leakage via log files

---

## 📊 QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS

### 6. Admin Error Notifications (NEW) ✅
**Files:**
- `includes/class-sync-manager.php` (lines 82-111, 158-223)
- Added `display_sync_errors()` method (lines 77-111)

**Features Added:**
- Visual admin notices when sync fails
- Transient-based error storage (5-minute expiration)
- Improved error handling in `fetch_catalog()`:
  - HTTP error detection
  - JSON decode error handling
  - Square API error parsing
  - Connection failure handling
  - Pagination safety (max 100 pages)
  - 30-second timeout added
- Quick access buttons to Settings and API Log

**User Impact:** Admins now see clear error messages instead of silent failures

---

### 7. Server Variable Sanitization (IMPROVED) ✅
**Files:**
- `smdp-webhook.php` (line 43) - Using `rest_url()` instead of `$_SERVER` variables
- `includes/constants.php` (lines 245-251) - IP validation with `filter_var()`

**Security Impact:** **LOW** - Prevents HTTP Host header attacks

---

## 🎯 TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

### 1. Webhook Testing
```bash
# Test invalid signature (should return 403)
curl -X POST https://yoursite.com/wp-json/smdp/v1/webhook \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-square-hmacsha256-signature: invalid" \
  -d '{"type":"catalog.version.updated"}'

# Expected: 403 Forbidden with {"success":false,"error":"Invalid signature"}
```

### 2. Rate Limiting Testing
```bash
# Test help request rate limit (should block after 5 requests in 60s)
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X POST https://yoursite.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php \
    -d "action=smdp_request_help&table=1&security=NONCE_HERE"
done

# Expected: First 5 succeed, remaining 5 return rate limit error
```

### 3. Validation Testing
- Try saving an invalid access token (too short, wrong chars) → Should show error
- Try saving an invalid location ID (wrong format) → Should show error
- Try accessing bill with invalid table format (`Table!@#`) → Should reject

### 4. Admin Notice Testing
- Clear access token
- Trigger a sync manually
- Check for admin notice on dashboard

---

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT NOTES

### Before Deploying:

1. **Backup your database** - Always backup before major updates
2. **Test on staging first** - Verify all functionality works
3. **Check Square webhook signature key** - Ensure it's properly stored
4. **Monitor error logs** after deployment for first 24 hours

### After Deploying:

1. Visit **Square Menu > Settings** and verify token is saved
2. Visit **Square Menu > Webhooks** and refresh webhook subscription
3. Test a catalog sync: **Settings > Sync Now**
4. Verify menu displays correctly on frontend
5. Test help/bill request buttons (if using tablets)

---

## 📞 SUPPORT & MAINTENANCE

### If Issues Occur:

1. Check **Square Menu > API Log** for error details
2. Look for admin notices on dashboard
3. Check WordPress debug.log (if WP_DEBUG enabled)
4. Verify Square access token has correct permissions

### Regular Maintenance:

- Review error logs weekly
- Monitor rate limiting events
- Keep WordPress and PHP updated
- Test webhook signature verification monthly

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

1. **Never bypass security for "debugging"** - The webhook bypass was dangerous
2. **Always validate external data** - Square IDs should be format-checked
3. **Multi-factor rate limiting is essential** - Single-factor is too easy to bypass
4. **Silent failures frustrate users** - Admin notices improve UX significantly
5. **Log only what's needed** - Excessive logging creates security risks

---

- [ ] Implement session-based authentication for tablets
- [ ] Add IP whitelist option for webhook endpoint
- [ ] Create security audit log viewer in admin

**Review Date:** January 2025
**Next Review:** Recommended after 90 days or on next major update

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **OAuth Users:** Webhooks still require personal access tokens (application-level feature)
2. **Debug Mode:** Disable `WP_DEBUG` in production to reduce log exposure
3. **Rate Limiting:** May need adjustment based on actual traffic patterns
4. **Backups:** Always maintain recent backups before deploying updates
